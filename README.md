# springboot-project-accelerator

Spring boot project accelerator that can serve as reference for bootstrapping projects using Java and Spring to produce a REST API.

The simple REST API provides two endpoints for geography data (/continents and /countries/{continentCode}).

## Get Started

1) Setup development tools and environment
    * https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-spring-boot
2) Clone repo
3) Build and run the application via "F5" in vscode (or run the debugger)
4) Exercise the API via postman

Download and install https://www.getpostman.com and then import the collection in the "postman" folder in file "SBPA-API.postman_collection.json" and run the requests to see api data and responses - see more info: https://learning.getpostman.com/docs
